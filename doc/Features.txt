SES - Super-Encypherment Scrambler Features
-------------------------------------------

* Encrypt or decrypt messages of arbitrary length - no limit on size
* Encrypt and decrypt files of any type or size (up to 4GB)
* Top security built on Bob Jenkins' ISAAC CSPRNG and the new SHA-3 standard Keccak.
* True one-time pad capability via the -o switch (use Random.org or similar)
* Multi-levels of encryption, including a ciphertext-hash & OTP outer shell for avalanche/diffusion
* Unique nonce IV guarantees different ciphertext each time, even on the same message and key
* Iterative 1024-bit key derivation - hashing, salting, stretching - makes a cracker's job harder
* The number of words in your key-phrase determines the number of cipher passes
* Includes the command line program and an optional graphical GTK+ shell for calling it
* Interactive and command-switch modes
* Tiny footprint - with pipeable / redirectable output
* Completely cross-platform and open source
* Package includes Linux and Windows executables, along with the full source code.
