ses - A Super-Encypherment Scrambler
------------------------------------

SES is both a console tool with pipeable output and an interactive application. Novice or new users are recommended first to try interactive mode, which is enabled simply by typing

ses -e

or

ses -d

For verbose demonstration of SES's encryption phases, you may type

ses -v -e

or

ses -v -d

-e encrypts, -d decrypts. It's all rather simple.


SES <options>. {} denotes an optional element.

-a Authentication (simple): ciphertext is checked against an auth-code.
-d Decipher { + ciphertext in double quotes }.
-D Securely delete file or OTP after encrypton { + number of passes }.
-e Encipher { + plaintext in double quotes. }
-f File to ISC-cipher byte by byte. Files of any type (up to 4GB).
-F Text File to SES-cipher line by line. Slow but very secure.
-g Groups. Default 4 letters. { + number after -g }.
-H { Ciphertext input and output as a string of hexadecimal digits }.
-k Key-phrase, quoted. Number of words dictates number of encipherments.
-m Modulo of ASCII set. { + 1 (=26), 2 (=95), 3 (=128), 4 (=256) }.
-o Filename of a true one-time pad from a source such as Random.org.
-v Verbose. Show output from each stage of the encryption or decryption.

-A Special acknowledgments.
-c The current SES Challenge.
-h This options screen.
-L Log-abbreviations legend.
-t Timer operations in -v mode.
-V Display SES version.

Example: > ses -e "quick brown fox" -k "secret key"
(encrypt "quick brown fox" on key "secret key")
Output:  > KKKMWDSGFUYWNBYITJTTNAVPAXXKRRPVNEYQTHWYXJUGLOYNS

In the absence of a quoted key and message, SES becomes interactive.
