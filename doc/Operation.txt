ses - A Super-Encypherment Scrambler
------------------------------------

SES is both a console tool with pipeable output and an interactive application. Novice or new users are recommended first to try interactive mode, which is enabled simply by typing

ses -e

or

ses -d

For verbose demonstration of SES's encryption phases, you may type

ses -v -e

or

ses -v -d

-e encrypts, -d decrypts. It's all rather simple.


SES <options>

-d Decipher, optionally followed by ciphertext in double quotes.
-e Encipher, optionally followed by plaintext  in double quotes.
-f File to encipher or decipher. Files of any type or size.
-k Key-phrase, quoted. Number of words dictates number of encipherments.
-o Filename of a true one-time pad from a source such as Random.org.
-v Verbose. Show output from each stage of the encryption and decryption.

-a Special acknowledgments.
-c The current SES Challenge.
-h This options screen.
-i Information and background.
-L Log-abbreviations legend.
-w GPL Warranty disclaimer.
-W GPL Terms and Conditions.

Example: > ses -e "quick brown fox" -k "secret key"
(encrypt "quick brown fox" on key "secret key")
Output:  > TVBVZYLFMZNWKFWBCMHMROHPYPQBDCUUYODZLPSDTCNAWFADZ

In the absence of a quoted key and message, SES becomes interactive.
