SES Super-Encypherment Scrambler
--------------------------------

Version 6.1.0-stable
--------------------
Minor update:
ISC-File ciphering now uses the mCaesar() function in place of rCaesar() to add additional confusion to the stream. This of course means that files enciphered with earlier versions of SES will not be decryptable with this version.
The -D switch optionally allows the secure deletion of a file after encryption.
Added the option to securely delete a file and simply exit. Just omit -d or -e to accomplish this (example: >ses -f otp.txt -D {passes}).
In response to some unwarranted criticism, ModTrial(.exe) - a program demonstrating conclusively the superiority of the MOD (%) operation for limiting the range of a PRNG in cryptographic applications - has been added to the SES distribution.
A 3rd-prize "no-brainer" problem has been added to the SES Challenge in addition to various "extras". 
SES-decipherment-wise, this version IS retro-compatible: Thus, the running version 6.0.0 SES Challenge ciphertexts still stand.


Version 6.0.0-stable
--------------------
Major update:
GSES, a GUI calling-shell for SES, has been officially added to the distribution in both source and binary form (it was unofficially present in some v5.0.0 archives). GSES permits drag-and-drop file ciphering operations and has much enhanced key-security. It will compile under the Lazarus Free Pascal IDE.
The -p option permits the addition of a file-path when ciphering files. SES operations are no longer confined to the calling-directory.
The -F option permits a full line-by-line super-enciphering of any text file: the strongest, and slowest, SES file ciphering option.
SES-decipherment-wise, this version IS NOT retro-compatible: Thus, the running version 5 SES Challenge no longer stands unless version 5.X.X is used.


Version 5.0.0-stable
--------------------
Major update:
SES has gained in strength by several orders of magnitude.
This has been achieved by seeding the ISAAC CSPRNG/stream cipher with 128-byte strings randomly generated from the entered key-phrase, and by performing salted key-stretching on the resultant ASCII seeds.
The new -m option now offers the choice of Caesar-shifting to modulo 95, 128 and 256 as well as the default 26 uppercase ASCII. Mod 95 (option 2) is the entire printable set of ASCII characters with start " " (space); mod 128 (3) and 256 (4) both begin at chr(0) in the ASCII table and, for obvious reasons, require a hexadecimal format for the output of the encipherment.
The -H option allows selection of hexadecimal output for all modulos.
The -t option permits timing of operations when in verbose mode.
File-ciphering is now fast (using a Vernam cipher on the ISAAC stream) and operates on files of any type, their size limited only by your available system memory (up to 4GB).
SES-decipherment-wise, this version IS NOT retro-compatible: Thus, the running version 4 SES Challenge no longer stands unless version 4.X.X is used.


Version 4.0.0-stable
-------------------
Major update:
Additional security has been achieved, in part, by completely decoupling the Vigenere and scrambler/OTP layers (should ISAAC break, there remains the new Vigenere/random Caesar to contend with, and vice-versa), as well as by the following additional measures:
The IV/Nonce/Ciphertext hash combo is now encrypted prior to use.
Your key-phrase and its constituent words are now thoroughly obfuscated.
The Vigenere layers have been greatly strengthened: Each keyword is now iteratively extended to message-length with random C-shift encryption. In effect, we are pseudo-OTP'ing and stream enciphering the keyphrase as well as the message.
Ciphertext may be authenticated (via the -a switch), making it easy to determine whether a message has been intercepted or tampered with. In the event of a failed authentication, decipherment is aborted.
Ciphertext can be split into letter groups (via the -g switch) for transmission by Morse, RTTY or Voice, and/or for manual decipherment using a hard-copy one-time-pad. Output can be piped into a morse code generation program such as ESR's morse for Linux. 
A script (getotp.php) for retrieving ready-to-use one-time pads from Random.org has been included in the distribution.
A more robust system for encoding numerals and symbols has been substituted for the former one.
SES-decipherment-wise, this version IS NOT retro-compatible: Thus, the running version 3 SES Challenge no longer stands unless version 3.X.X is used.


Version 3.6.0-stable
--------------------
(not released - 3.6.0 features carried over into 4.0.0-stable)


Version 3.5.0-stable
--------------------
Feature update:
A unique nonce IV ensures that EVERY ciphertext is different, even the same message encrypted with the same key.
SES-decipherment-wise, this version IS retro-compatible:
Thus, the running version 3.0 SES Challenge still stands.


Version 3.4.1-stable
--------------------
Status & Patch update:
Fixed a text processing glitch: "@" is now translated correctly.
Project status changed to STABLE.


Version 3.4.0-alpha
-------------------
Feature update:
Via the new -o switch, SES now supports the use of a real one-time pad of random numbers collected from a truly random noise source, such as http://random.org
Please see the file one-time-pad.txt in the source directory of the distribution archive for instructions on the creation and use of an otp.txt file.
SES-encipherment-wise, this version IS retro-compatible:
Thus, the running version 3.0 SES Challenge still stands.


Version 3.3.0-alpha
-------------------
Feature update:
Added text-file encipherment/decipherment through the -f switch.
SES will now encrypt and decrypt strings of arbitrary length - no longer limited to 255 characters.
Added -L switch to display a legend for the log-abbreviations.
As a non-major update, this version IS retro-compatible:
Thus, the running version 3.0 SES Challenge still stands.


Version 3.2.0-alpha
-------------------
Minor feature update:
Added text sanity checks to Decipher mode
Many cosmetic improvements in textual output
As a minor update, this version IS retro-compatible:
Thus, the running version 3.0 SES Challenge still stands.


Version 3.1.0-alpha
-------------------
Minor feature update:
Greatly enhanced the program's error trapping and reporting
Added -w switch to display comprehensive Warranty information
Added -W switch to display the complete GPL terms and conditions
Added -c switch to display the current SES Challenge
Added -a switch to display special acknowledgments 
As a minor update, this version IS retro-compatible:
Thus, the running version 3.0 SES Challenge still stands.


Version 3.0.0-alpha
-------------------
Major update:
Version 3.0 adds a Keccak 224 ciphertext-hash for avalanche / diffusion,
plus an OTP-enciphered outer layer protecting the core encryption sequence.
The preset CSPRNG seed is now determined by this new hash digest.
The preset scramble-depth is now determined randomly.
For these reasons, version 3.0 is NOT retro-compatible with previous releases and supersedes them. 
Thus, the running version 2.0 SES Challenge no longer stands as published, having been replaced by the version 3.0 SES Challenge.
